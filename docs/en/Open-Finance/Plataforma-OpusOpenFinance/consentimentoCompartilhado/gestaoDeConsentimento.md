## What Our Solution Implements

Once the user logs in through your application, they will have access to a series of screens in compliance with the latest Banco Central regulations.

Our goal is to ensure that throughout the entire Open Finance journey, clients have **full control** over their **data** and **sharing permissions**, managing their linked accounts and consents simply and efficiently.

The developed screens are organized into:

- **Management Screens (Data Transmission and Reception)**, which enable consent and account linkage management, providing full control over shared information.

After user authentication, they will have access to the described screens:

### Transmission - Management Screens (Item 05 - Management Area)

**Note:** The screens presented in this section are contained in the User Experience Guide, Item 05 – Management Area. More details at [this link](https://openfinancebrasil.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OF/pages/1477279745/v.19.00.01+Guia+de+Experi+ncia+do+Usu+rio+Open+Finance+Brasil).

The management screens focus on managing Open Finance consents. These screens provide the user with clear and efficient control over their data sharing, payment authorizations, and account linkages.
