  title: API Customers - Opus Data Receiver
  description: |
    API for customer registration data stored in ODR. Uses the same standard definition as the Open Finance Brazil - Phase 2 registration data.
    API that returns customer registration data and their representatives, including identification data, financial qualification information, registered representative information, and information about the customer's financial relationship with the data transmitting institution.\
    Has segregation between natural persons and legal entities.\
    Requires customer registration in ODR for all `endpoints`.

    # Guidelines
    In the context of Open Finance, the directory `Role` related to this API is `DATA`.\
    Data will be returned in the query as long as the related `setupId` corresponds to a valid customer registration in ODR with status `AUTHORISED`.\
    It is also necessary that the resource in question (account, contract, etc.) is available at the transmitting institution (i.e., without any type of block and with all authorizations/consents already authorized).\
    Additionally, the required `permissions` must have been requested when creating the related customer registration in ODR (`setupId`).\
    We list below the `permissions` required for data query in each `endpoint` of this API.

    ## Required permissions for the Customers API

    For each of the paths in this API, in addition to the indicated scopes (`scopes`), there are `permissions` that must be observed:

    ### `/setup/personal/identifications`
