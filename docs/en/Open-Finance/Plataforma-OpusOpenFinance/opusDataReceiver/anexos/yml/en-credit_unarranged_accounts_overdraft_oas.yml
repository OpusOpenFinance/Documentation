  title: API Unarranged-accounts-overdraft - Opus Data Receiver
  description: |
    API for deposit advance operations information stored in ODR. Uses as standard the same definition of deposit advance operations from Open Finance Brazil – Phase 2.

    API that returns information about credit operations of the deposit advance type, maintained by transmitting institutions for their clients, including data such as denomination, 
    modality, contract number, fees, term, installments, payments (at least for the last 12 months), amortizations, guarantees, charges and remuneratory interest rates.
    
    No segregation between natural person and legal entity.
    Requires client registration in ODR for all `endpoints`.

    # Guidelines
    In the context of Open Finance, the `Role` in the participant directory related to this API is `DATA`.
    Data will be returned in the query as long as the related `setupId` corresponds to a valid client registration in ODR with status `AUTHORISED`.
    It is also necessary that the resource in question (account, contract, etc.) is available at the transmitting institution (i.e., without any type of blockages and with all authorizations/consents already authorized).
    Additionally, the necessary `permissions` must have been requested when creating the related client registration in ODR (`setupId`).
    Below we list the necessary `permissions` for data query in each `endpoint` of this API.

    ### Note
      - In the endpoint `/setup/credit/unarranged-accounts-overdraft/contracts/{contractId}/payments` pagination will occur on the data contained in the `releases` field of list type.
