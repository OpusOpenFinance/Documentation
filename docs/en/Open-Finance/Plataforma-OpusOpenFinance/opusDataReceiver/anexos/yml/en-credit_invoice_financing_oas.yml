  title: API Invoice-financings - Opus Data Receiver
  description: |
    API for receivables anticipation operation information stored in ODR. Uses the same definition as Open Finance Brazil - Phase 2.

    API that returns information on receivables anticipation-type credit operations held by customers at transmitting institutions, including data such as denomination, modality, contract number, fees, term, installments, payments (at least for the last 12 months), amortizations, guarantees, charges and remuneratory interest rates. \
    
    There is no segregation between individuals and legal entities.\
    
    Requires customer registration in the ODR for all `endpoints`.

    # Guidelines
    In the context of Open Finance, the `Role` in the participant directory related to this API is `DADOS`.\
    It is also necessary that the resource in question (account, contract, etc.) is available at the transmitting institution (i.e., without any blockages and with all authorizations/consents already approved).\
    Additionally, the required `permissions` must have been requested when creating the related customer registration in the ODR (`setupId`).\
    Below we list the `permissions` required for data query in each `endpoint` of this API.

    ### Note:
      - In the endpoint `/setup/credit/invoice-financing/contracts/{contratId}/payments` pagination will occur on the data contained in the `releases` field of type list.   

    ## Permissions required for the Invoice-financings API

    For each of the paths in this API, in addition to the indicated scopes (`scopes`), there are `permissions` that must be observed:

    ### `/setup/credit/invoice-financing/contracts`
      - permissions:
        - GET: **INVOICE_FINANCINGS_READ**
    ### `/setup/credit/invoice-financing/contracts/{contractId}`

Since the installment value is fixed, over the installments, the amortization value increases.
