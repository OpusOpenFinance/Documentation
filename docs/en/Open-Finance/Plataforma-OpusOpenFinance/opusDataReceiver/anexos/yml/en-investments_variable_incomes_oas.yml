  title: API Variable Incomes - Opus Data Receiver
  description: |
    API for Variable Income operations information stored in ODR. Uses the same definition of Variable Income from Open Finance Brazil - Phase 4 as standard.

    API that returns information about Variable Income investment operations held by their clients in transmitting institutions, including data such as product information, quantity, client position balances, financial transactions, and trading note details.

    No segregation between natural and legal persons. Requires client registration in ODR for all endpoints.

    The granularity of variable income operations exposure is per each asset (ticker) in the client's portfolio.
    Sharing considers standard and fractional lots, however, in Open Finance Brazil, information is consolidated via standard lot ticker.
    The lag in relation to the institution's electronic channel should be the previous day's closing (trading session) (d-1).

    Regarding stock lending: currently not part of the sharing scope is the client's lending portfolio/position (loaned assets and related movements of these assets).
    Only transactions of interest payments or receipts from stock lending (or donation) contracts by clients should be shared.

    Regarding FIAGRO and FII products: when traded over-the-counter, they are outside the scope of Open Finance.

    For the investment identifier (investmentId) the following behavior should be adopted:

    - After 12 months without transactions and with asset quantity zeroed, the resourceId corresponding to the investmentId in question should change to UNAVAILABLE status (considering valid client registration in ODR);

    - In situations where the client repurchases the asset after a period of 12 months without transaction and with asset quantity zeroed, the same identifier (investmentId) should be used. Specifically for such products, the resource status in resources should change from UNAVAILABLE to AVAILABLE.

    Below is a table with the product scope to be considered for sharing:
