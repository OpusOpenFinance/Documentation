  title: API Funds - Opus Data Receiver
  description: |
    API for Investment Funds operations information stored in ODR. Uses the same definition of Investment Funds from Open Finance Brazil - Phase 4 as standard.

    API that returns information about Investment Funds investment operations held by their clients in transmitting institutions, including data such as product information, quantity, client position balances, and financial transactions.

    No segregation between natural and legal persons. Requires client registration in ODR for all endpoints.

    As exposure scope, all investment funds classified as: Fixed Income, Equity, Multimarket and Foreign Exchange should be considered.

    For product identification and client position, exposure will be consolidated per Investment Fund.

    For transactions, exposure will be by Client Order, for example, a Redemption Order is shared as a single transaction, even if associated with different Certificates (Certificates).

    Institutions may present different scenarios regarding synchronization between position `/balances` and transaction `/transactions` and `/transactions-current` of the API:

    - Some institutions reflect unconverted transactions in the client position in their electronic channels. This implies that updated position sharing may occur, whose related transactions will be exposed in the ecosystem only after their conversion;

    - Other institutions reflect in the position only converted transactions in their electronic channels. This implies that position sharing in relation to transactions is done in a synchronized manner in the ecosystem.

    For the investment identifier (investmentId) the following behavior should be adopted:

    - After 12 months without transactions and with asset quantity zeroed, the resourceId corresponding to the investmentId in question should change to UNAVAILABLE status (considering valid consent);

    - In situations where the client repurchases the asset after a period of 12 months without transaction and with asset quantity zeroed, the same identifier (investmentId) should be used. Specifically for such products, the resource status in resources should change from UNAVAILABLE to AVAILABLE.
