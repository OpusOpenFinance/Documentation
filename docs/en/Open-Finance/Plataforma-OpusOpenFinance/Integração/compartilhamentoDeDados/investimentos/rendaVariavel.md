## Variable Income API

In general, there are *endpoints* for:

- Retrieving records of operations of the variable income securities held by the client;
- Retrieving the identification records of the variable income securities;
- Retrieving the position records in the variable income securities;
- Retrieving transaction history records for the last 12 months;
- Retrieving history records for the last seven days.

### *Open API Specification* of the API

The documentation for the variable income API to be built in the integration layer can be found [**here**][API-Variable-Income]
