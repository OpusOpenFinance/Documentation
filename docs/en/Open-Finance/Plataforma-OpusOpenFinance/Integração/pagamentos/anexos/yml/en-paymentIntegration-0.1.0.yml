  description: |
    Payment Initiation API, responsible for enabling payment initiation
    operations for Opus Open Finance Brasil.

    It must be made available by the Account Holding Institution and will receive requests made by Opus Open
    Finance Brasil.

    # Payment Scenarios to Be Covered by the Integration

    In implementing the payment integration, it is necessary to cover the creation and query of payments in each of the following scenarios.

    For payments held for analysis (status "PDNG" in Open Finance) or scheduled, it is also necessary to include the possibility of payment revocation.

    ## Scenarios by Type of Logged User

    - **Individual (PF)**
    - **Legal Entity (PJ)** *(when supported by the financial institution's backend)*

    ## Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date

    - **Immediate**: Payments to be settled on the same day of the request.
    - **Scheduled**: Payments to be settled on a future date.

    ## Scenarios by Payment Initiation Method

    - **MANU**: Initiated by manual entry of bank details.
    - **INIC**: Initiated by the creditor.
    - **DICT**: Initiated using a Pix key.
    - **QRES**: Initiated by Static QR Code.
    - **QRDN**: Initiated by Dynamic QR Code.

    ## Scenarios by Payment Attempt Type

    The Pix Arrangement enables retries for specific payments, such as automatic Pix.  
    When making a Pix payment via Open Finance, the integration must properly handle the following payment attempts:

    - **Original Request:** The first attempt to execute the payment, which occurs for all payments.
    - **Extra-day Retry:** Only supported for specific payments (e.g., automatic Pix). It is a new attempt made on a different day than the original attempt.

    **⚠️ Important:** Intra-day retry (carried out on the same day), when applicable, must be identified and handled by the financial institution's backend system.

    ## How to Identify the Scenarios

    Below is a more technical overview of the rules for identifying the payment scenarios described above.

    The field analysis below is performed on the payload of the payment creation request.

    ### How to Identify the Type of Logged User

    | Field `consent.businessDocumentType.document.identification` | Interpretation |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
    | Absent                                                      | Individual (PF) User    |
    | Filled                                                      | Legal Entity (PJ) User    |

    ---

    **ℹ️ Note:** Regardless of the user type, their CPF will be available in the `consent.loggedUser.document.identification` field.

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Payment Settlement Date

    The field that defines the payment date varies according to the payment type (`paymentType` field):

    - If `paymentType` is `PAYMENT_CONSENT`

    | Field `consent.payment.schedule`          | Scenario     | Payment Date                      |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | **Absent**                               | Immediate | Current date                             |
    | Has subfield `single`                  | Scheduled    | `consent.payment.schedule.single.date` |
    | Has subfield **different** from `single` | Scheduled    | `requestBody.data.date`                |

    ---

    - If `paymentType` is `PAYMENT_RECURRING_CONSENT`

    | Field `requestBody.data.date` | Scenario     | Payment Date       |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
    | Is **current** date              | Immediate | Current date              |
    | Is **future** date             | Scheduled    | `requestBody.data.date` |

    ---

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Initiation Method and the Creditor

    The payment **initiation method** is determined by the value of the `requestBody.data.localInstrument` field.  
    The method for identifying the **creditor** varies according to the informed initiation type.

    The table below summarizes the fields for identifying each scenario:

    | Initiation Method | Fields used to identify the creditor                     |
    | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    |        MANU        | `creditorAccount` (Object with bank information)               |
    |        INIC        | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` (Pix Key)                            |
    |        DICT        | `creditorAccount` + `proxy`                                        |
    |        QRES        | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` + `qrCode` (String with the scanned QR Code) |
    |        QRDN        | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` + `qrCode`                             |

    ---

    **⚠️ Important:** When there is more than one identification method, consistency between them must be validated.
    Example: the Pix key must refer to the same account indicated in the creditorAccount field.

    **ℹ️ Note:** All fields mentioned in the table above are located within `requestBody.data`.

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Payment Attempt

    | Field `requestBody.data.originalRecurringPaymentId` | Interpretation        |
    | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
    | Absent                                             | Original Attempt   |
    | Filled with the original payment ID           | Extra-day Retry |

    # Mandatory Validations for Payments

    The following validations must be implemented in the specific route for payment data validation.

    For each validation, the error listed in the integration response must present in the `code` field the corresponding code, as indicated.

    ## Payment Maximum Value Validation

    **ℹ️ Notes:**

    - Validation performed for payments of type `PAYMENT_CONSENT` (value of the `requestBody.paymentType` field).
    - All other fields below are located within `requestBody.data.payment`.

    ### Rule

    The transaction value (`amount` field) must be below:

    - The limit established by the Holding Institution (if it exists).
    - The absolute maximum value, in reais, of `999999999.99` (i.e., up to 9 digits before the decimal point and 2 after).
        - The value **cannot** be equal to the maximum limit.

    **Error code:** `VALOR_ACIMA_LIMITE`

    ## QR Code Validations

    **ℹ️ Notes:**

    - Validations performed for payments of type `PAYMENT_CONSENT` (value of the `requestBody.paymentType` field).
    - All other fields below are located within `requestBody.data.payment`.

    ### General Rules

    1. The QR Code type must be consistent with the payment initiation method (`details.localInstrument` field):
        - If the initiation method is **QRES**, the QR Code must be **Static**.
        - If the initiation method is **QRDN**, the QR Code must be **Dynamic**.
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    ### If the QR Code is **Static**

    1. The value present in the Static QR Code must be the same as informed in the payment payload (`amount` field).
        - **Error code:** `VALOR_INVALIDO`

    2. The Pix key present in the Static QR Code must be identical to the Pix key informed in the payment payload (`details.proxy` field).
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    ### If the QR Code is **Dynamic**

    1. The status of the Dynamic QR Code must be valid for use.
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    # Integration - Frequently Asked Questions

    ## About Resource Discovery

    Questions regarding the resource discovery process in Opus Open Finance. For more information, check `en/integration-plugin/consent/readme.md` in the product documentation.

    **What is a "resource"?**

    In Open Finance, "resources" are data or service components that can be consumed by APIs, respecting security and consent criteria.
    In practice, a "resource" can be a transactional account, a card, an investment, among others.

    **What should I return in the `key` fields of `resourceLegacyId` and `resourceName`?**

    The `resourceLegacyId` and `resourceName` fields function as internal identifiers in the financial institution's backend and must be defined for use in this layer. Both are structured as lists of *key-value* pairs to support composite identifiers.

    For `resourceLegacyId`, if the ID is simple, it is sufficient to return something like:

    ```json
    "resourceLegacyId": [
        { "key": "id", "value": "<id value>" }
    ]
    ```

    For `resourceName`, it is important to return values that help the end user recognize the resource. For example, in the case of a bank account, you could return something like:

    ```json
    "resourceName": [
        { "key": "branch", "value": "<branch number>" },
        { "key": "account", "value": "<account number>" }
    ]
    ```

    **The user has no accounts to return. Should I return an error or an empty list?**

    If the user has no accounts, the return should be success (HTTP 200) with an empty list of resources (`{ "data": { "resources": [] } }`).

    **In the account discovery for the payment flow, which account should come as "selected by default"?**

    If the `debtorAccount` field of the consent is filled with a valid account for payments, that account should be marked as "selected by default" (`"defaultSelected": true`). Regardless, all accounts available for payment must be returned.

    ## About Payment Data Validation

    **What should be validated in the specific route for payment data validation?**

    Check the section ["Mandatory Validations for Payments"](#mandatory-validations-for-payments).

    ## About Payment Creation Requests

    **How to identify the account chosen by the holder for debit?**

    After the payment consent is approved, the `consent.resources` list sent in the payment request payload will always contain only one single resource, representing the selected account.  
    The `consent.debtorAccount` field will also always be filled with the information of the chosen account.

    **Where to find the payment date for each scenario or payment type?**

    Check the section ["Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date"](#scenarios-by-payment-settlement-date).

    **Does the financial institution's backend need to support Recurring Schedules?**

    No. The product will make a separate request for each recurrence date.

    For example, upon receiving a recurring schedule request for 5 months, one debit per month, the product will request 5 independent schedules from the financial institution's backend.  
    The date of each schedule must be determined as described in the section ["Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date"](#scenarios-by-payment-settlement-date).
