## Credit Cards API

The *integration layer* API that returns information about *postpaid payment accounts* held by transmitting institutions for their clients, including data such as denomination, product, brand, credit limits, payment transaction details, and invoices.

This API does not separate between individual and corporate clients.

Before any *endpoint* is triggered, the platform has already verified the authenticity of the request's origin, the validity, expiration date, permissions, and scope of the consent sent by the receiver, ensuring that the request is authorized.

There are endpoints for:

- Retrieving the list of postpaid accounts held by the client at the transmitting institution;
- Retrieving identification data of a credit card;
- Retrieving the list of invoices for a card;
- Retrieving the list of transactions for a card;
- Retrieving the credit limits for a card;
- Retrieving the list of recent transactions (last 7 days) for a card.

### *Open API Specification* of the API
