  description: |
    Payment Initiation API, responsible for enabling payment initiation operations
    for Opus Open Finance Brasil.

    It must be made available by the Account Holder Institution and will receive requests made by Opus Open
    Finance Brasil.

    # Payment Scenarios to Be Covered by the Integration

    In the implementation of the payment integration, it is necessary to cover the creation and consultation of payments in each of the following scenarios.

    For payments held for analysis (“PDNG” status in Open Finance) or scheduled payments, it is also necessary to consider the possibility of payment revocation.

    ## Scenarios by Logged User Type

    - **Pessoa Física (PF)** (Individual)
    - **Pessoa Jurídica (PJ)** *(when supported by the financial institution's backend)*

    ## Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date

    - **Instantaneous**: Payments to be settled on the same day of the request.
    - **Scheduled**: Payments to be settled on a future date.

    ## Scenarios by Payment Initiation Method

    - **MANU**: Initiated by manual entry of banking data.
    - **INIC**: Initiated by the receiver (*creditor*).
    - **DICT**: Initiated using a Pix key.
    - **QRES**: Initiated by Static QR Code.
    - **QRDN**: Initiated by Dynamic QR Code.

    ## Scenarios by Payment Attempt Type

    The Pix Arrangement allows retries for specific payments, such as automatic Pix.
    When performing a Pix through Open Finance, the integration must properly handle the following payment attempts:

    - **Original Request:** The first attempt at executing the payment, which occurs for all payments.
    - **Extraday Retry:** Only supported for specific payments (e.g., automatic Pix). It is a new attempt performed on a day different from the original attempt.

    **⚠️ Important:** Intraday retries (performed on the same day), when applicable, must be identified and handled by the financial institution's backend.

    ## How to Identify the Scenarios

    Below is a more technical view of the rules for identifying the payment scenarios described above.

    The field analysis below is made for the payment creation request payload.

    ### How to Identify the Logged User Type

    | Field `consent.businessDocumentType.document.identification` | Interpretation |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
    | Absent                                                       | Individual (PF) |
    | Present                                                      | Legal Entity (PJ) |

    ---

    **ℹ️ Note:** Regardless of user type, the user's CPF will always be available in `consent.loggedUser.document.identification`.

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Payment Settlement Date

    The field that defines the payment date varies according to the payment type (`paymentType`):

    - When `paymentType` is `PAYMENT_CONSENT`

    | Field `consent.payment.schedule`       | Scenario     | Payment Date                         |
    | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
    | **Absent**                              | Instantaneous | Current date                          |
    | Has subfield `single`                   | Scheduled    | `consent.payment.schedule.single.date` |
    | Has subfield **different** from `single`| Scheduled    | `requestBody.data.date` |

    ---

    - When `paymentType` is `PAYMENT_RECURRING_CONSENT`

    | Field `requestBody.data.date` | Scenario     | Payment Date            |
    | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
    | Is **current** date           | Instantaneous | Current date           |
    | Is **future** date            | Scheduled    | `requestBody.data.date` |

    ---

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Initiation Method and the Receiver (creditor)

    The **payment initiation method** is determined by `requestBody.data.localInstrument`.  
    The **receiver (creditor)** identification varies according to the initiation method.

    The table below summarizes the fields for identifying each scenario:

    | Initiation Method | Fields used to identify the receiver                       |
    | :---------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
    |        MANU       | `creditorAccount` (Object with banking info)               |
    |        INIC       | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` (Pix Key)                      |
    |        DICT       | `creditorAccount` + `proxy`                                |
    |        QRES       | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` + `qrCode` (String of QR Code) |
    |        QRDN       | `creditorAccount` + `proxy` + `qrCode`                     |

    ---

    **⚠️ Important:** When more than one identification method exists, consistency must be validated.
    Example: the Pix key must refer to the same account provided in `creditorAccount`.

    **ℹ️ Note:** All fields mentioned in the table above are located within `requestBody.data`.

    <br>

    ### How to Identify the Payment Attempt

    | Field `requestBody.data.originalRecurringPaymentId` | Interpretation        |
    | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
    | Absent                                              | Original Attempt      |
    | Filled with original payment ID                     | Extraday Retry        |

    # Mandatory Validations for Payments

    The following validations must be implemented in the specific route for validating payment data.

    For each validation, the error listed in the integration response must include in the `code` field the corresponding code as indicated.

    ## Validation of Maximum Payment Value

    **ℹ️ Notes:**

    - Validation performed for payments of type `PAYMENT_CONSENT` (`requestBody.paymentType`).
    - All fields below are located inside `requestBody.data.payment`.

    ### Rule

    The transaction amount (`amount`) must be below:

    - The limit established by the Account Holder Institution (if any).
    - The absolute maximum value in BRL: `999999999.99` (up to 9 digits before the decimal point and 2 after).
        - The value **cannot** be equal to the maximum limit.

    **Error code:** `VALOR_ACIMA_LIMITE`

    ## QR Code Validations

    **ℹ️ Notes:**

    - Validations performed for payments of type `PAYMENT_CONSENT` (`requestBody.paymentType`).
    - All fields below are located inside `requestBody.data.payment`.

    ### General Rules

    1. The QR Code type must match the payment initiation method (`details.localInstrument`):
        - If initiation is **QRES**, the QR Code must be **Static**.
        - If initiation is **QRDN**, the QR Code must be **Dynamic**.
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    ### If the QR Code is **Static**

    1. The value present in the Static QR Code must match the payment payload (`amount`).
        - **Error code:** `VALOR_INVALIDO`

    2. The Pix key in the Static QR Code must be identical to the Pix key in the payment payload (`details.proxy`).
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    ### If the QR Code is **Dynamic**

    1. The Dynamic QR Code status must be valid for use.
        - **Error code:** `QRCODE_INVALIDO`

    # Integration - Frequently Asked Questions

    ## About Resource Discovery

    Questions related to the resource discovery process in Opus Open Finance. For more information, check `pt-br/integração-plugin/consent/readme.md` in the product documentation.

    **What is a "resource"?**

    In Open Finance, “resources” are data or service components that can be consumed by APIs, following security and consent requirements.
    In practice, a “resource” may be a bank account, a card, an investment, among others.

    **What should I return in the `key` fields of `resourceLegacyId` and `resourceName`?**

    The fields `resourceLegacyId` and `resourceName` act as internal identifiers in the financial institution's backend and must be defined for use at this layer. Both are structured as lists of key-value pairs to support composite identifiers.

    For `resourceLegacyId`, if the ID is simple, you may return something like:

    ```json
    "resourceLegacyId": [
        { "key": "id", "value": "<id value>" }
    ]
    ```

    For `resourceName`, it is important to return values that help the end-user recognize the resource. For example, for a bank account:

    ```json
    "resourceName": [
        { "key": "agencia", "value": "<branch number>" },
        { "key": "conta", "value": "<account number>" }
    ]
    ```

    **The user has no accounts to return. Should I return an error or an empty list?**

    If the user does not have accounts, the return must be successful (HTTP 200) with an empty resource list (`{ "data": { "resources": [] } }`).

    **In the discovery of payment flow accounts, which account should appear as "pre-selected"?**

    If consent’s `debtorAccount` field is filled with a valid account for payments, that account must be marked as `"defaultSelected": true`.  
    Regardless, all accounts available for payment must be returned.

    ## About Payment Data Validation

    **What must be validated in the specific payment-data validation route?**

    See the section ["Mandatory Validations for Payments"](#mandatory-validations-for-payments).

    ## About Payment Creation Requests

    **How to identify the account chosen by the payer for debit?**

    After payment consent approval, the `consent.resources` list in the payment request payload will always contain exactly one resource, representing the selected account.  
    The field `consent.debtorAccount` will also always be filled with the selected account.

    **Where to find the payment date for each scenario or payment type?**

    See the section ["Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date"](#scenarios-by-payment-settlement-date).

    **Does the financial institution's backend need to support Recurring Scheduling?**

    No. The product will make a separate request for each recurrence date.

    For example, for a 5-month recurring schedule (one debit per month), the product will request 5 separate scheduling operations from the financial institution’s backend.  
    The date for each scheduling must follow the rules described in ["Scenarios by Payment Settlement Date"](#scenarios-by-payment-settlement-date).
