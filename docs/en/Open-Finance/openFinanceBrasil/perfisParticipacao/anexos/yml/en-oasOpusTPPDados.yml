                A URN, as defined in [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141), is a Uniform Resource 
                Identifier - URI - that is assigned under the URI scheme "urn" and a specific URN namespace, with the intention that the URN 
                be a persistent and location-independent resource identifier.
