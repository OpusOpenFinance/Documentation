        Method to reject, revoke or edit a long-term consent:  
        1 - Information about revocation:
        - If successful, the consent moves to "REVOKED" status;
        - Only consents with "AUTHORISED" status can be revoked;
        - Automatic payments associated with the consent that are scheduled to occur until 11:59 PM of the next day (from the date of 
        revocation request) must be maintained. Payments scheduled to occur after this period must be canceled.
        - Other guidelines regarding revocation can be found in the API header, topic "Validations", item 3.

        2 - Information about editing: 
        - The fields that can be edited and their rules can be found at [link](https://openfinancebrasil.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OF/pages/198410772);
        - Editing is only possible in cases of Automatic Pix consent ("automatic" chosen in the oneOf of the "recurringConfiguration" object);
        - Sending the "/data/creditors/name" item will update the receiver's name in all elements of the array.

        3 - Information about rejection:  
        - If there is a need to cancel a consent that has not yet been authorized, the initiator can call the endpoint to move the consent to REJECTED.

                The consentId is the unique identifier of the consent and must be a URN - Uniform Resource Name.
                A URN, as defined in [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141), is a Uniform Resource
                Identifier - URI - that is assigned under the URI scheme "urn" and a specific URN namespace, with the intention that the URN
                be a persistent and location-independent resource identifier.

                - the specific identifier within the namespace (C1DD33123).
